Revision history for Perl extension Data::BitStream::XS.

0.02
	- Fix tests on 5.6/5.8 that broke things at the last minute.
	- Change // comments and mixed declarations to allow compilation with
	  old C compilers (--std=c89 --ansi -pedantic).
	  Variadic macros still being used however.
	- Try to match word size with Perl word size.  Hopefully will fix
	  issues with LLP64 model machines using 64-bit Perl.
