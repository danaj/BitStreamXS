Revision history for Perl extension Data::BitStream::XS.

0.03
  - Tracked down the LLP64 (32-bit long, 64-bit long long) issue down to using
    an unsigned long in the .xs get_* macro.  Fixed.  After v0.02, pure 32-bit
    and pure 64-bit systems would work, but 64-bit Perl on 32-bit O/S didn't.
    It should work now.
  - Allow Omega to encode 0 - ~0 instead of 0 - ~0-1.  All codes are full range.
  - Better use of const pointers.
  - Code run through valgrind.
  - More consistent error status.
  - On code errors or reading off end of stream, position should remain
    unchanged (if they trap the croak).  Many codes have changes to make this
    happen, and a new test is added to find a lot of these issues.  It is not
    complete.
  - Added examples, mainly copied from Data::BitStream.
  - New fheader() and new(fheader => ...) methods added to finish off the
    compatibility with Data::BitStream in file I/O.


0.02
  - Fix tests on 5.6/5.8 that broke things at the last minute.
  - Change // comments and mixed declarations to allow compilation with
    old C compilers (--std=c89 --ansi -pedantic).
    Variadic macros still being used however.
  - Try to match word size with Perl word size.  Hopefully will fix
    issues with LLP64 model machines using 64-bit Perl.
