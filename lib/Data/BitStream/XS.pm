# ABSTRACT: A bit stream class including integer coding methods.

=pod

=head1 NAME

Data::BitStream::XS - A bit stream class including integer coding methods

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::BitStream::XS;
  my $stream = Data::BitStream::XS->new;
  $stream->put_gamma($_) for (1 .. 20);
  $stream->rewind_for_read;
  my @values = $stream->get_gamma(-1);

See L<Data::BitStream> for more examples.




=head1 DESCRIPTION

An XS implementation providing read/write access to bit streams.  This includes
many integer coding methods as well as straightforward ways to implement new
codes.

Bit streams are often used in data compression and in embedded products where
memory is at a premium.

This code provides a nearly drop-in XS replacement for the L<Data::BitStream>
module.  If you do not need the flexibility of the Moose/Mouse system, you can
use this directly.

Versions 0.03 and later of the L<Data::BitStream> class will attempt to use
this XS class if it is available.  Most operations will be 50-100 times faster,
while not sacrificing any of its flexibility, so it is highly recommended.  In
other words, if this module is installed, any code using L<Data::BitStream>
will automatically speed up.

While direct use of the XS class is a bit faster than going through Mouse/Moose,
the vast majority of the benefit is internal.  Hence, for maximum portability
and flexibility just install this module for the speed, and continue using the
L<Data::BitStream> class as usual.




=head1 METHODS




=head2 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item B< new >

Creates a new object.  By default it has no associated file, is mode RW, and
has maxlen 0 (no space allocated).  An optional hash of arguments may be
supplied.  Examples:

  $stream = Data::BitStream::XS->new( size => 10_000 );

Indicates an initial start size of C<10,000> bits.  The normal behavior is to
expand the data area as needed, but this can be used to make an initial
allocation.  A small amount of time will be saved, and it will be more space
efficient if the number of bits is known in advance.  This often will be a
premature optimization.

  $stream = Data::BitStream::XS->new( mode => 'ro' );

The stream is opened as a read-only stream.  Attempts to open it for write will
fail, hence all write / put methods will also fail.  This is most useful for
opening a file for read, which will ensure no changes are made.

Possible modes include C<'read' / 'r'>, C<'readonly' / 'ro'>, C<'write' / 'w'>,
C<'writeonly' / 'wo'>, C<'append' / 'a'>, and C<'readwrite' / 'rw' / 'rdwr'>.

  $stream = Data::BitStream::XS->new( file    => "c.bsc",
                                      fheader => "HEADER $foo $bar",
                                      mode    => 'w' );

A file is associated with the stream.  Upon closing the file, going out of
scope, or otherwise being destroyed, the stream will be written to the file,
with the given header string written first.  While the current implementation
writes at close time, later implementations may write as the stream is written
to.

  $stream = Data::BitStream::XS->new( file => "c.bsc",
                                      fheaderlines => 1,
                                      mode => 'ro' );

A file is associated with the stream.  The contents of the file will be
slurped into the stream.  The given number of header lines will be skipped
at the start (with their contents put into fheader so they can be retrieved).
While the current implementation slurps the contents, later implementations
may read from the file as the stream is read.

=item B< maxbits >

Returns the number of bits in a word, which is the largest allowed size of
the C<bits> argument to C<read> and C<write>.  This will be either 32 or 64.

It is theoretically possible that the maximum bits for this class and Perl
do not match.  So this class may report 32-bit maxbits while Perl is 64-bit,
and vice-versa.  This would usually happen only if it was loaded into a
different Perl than it was compiled for.

=item B< code_is_supported >

Returns a hash of information about a code if it is known, and C<undef>
otherwise.

The argument is a text name, such as C<'Gamma'>, C<'Rice(2)'>, etc.

=item B< code_is_universal >

Returns C<undef> if the code is not known, C<0> if the code is non-universal,
and a non-zero integer if it is universal.

The argument is a text name, such as C<'Gamma'>, C<'Rice(2)'>, etc.

A code is universal if there exists a constant C<C> such that C<C> plus the
length of the code is less than the optimal code length, for all values.  What
this typically means for us in practical terms is that non-universal codes
are fine for small numbers, but their size increases rapidly, making them
inappropriate when large values are possible (no matter how rare).  A
classic non-universal code is Unary coding, which takes C<k+1> bits to
store value C<k>.  This is very good if most values are 0 or near zero.  If
we have rare values in the tens of thousands, it's not so great.  It is
likely to be fatal if we ever come across a value of 2 billion.

=item B< add_code >

Used for the dispatch table methods C<code_put> and C<code_get> as well as
other helper methods like C<code_is_universal> and C<code_is_supported>.
This is typically handled internally, but can be used to register a new code
or variant.  An example of an Omega-Golomb code:

   Data::BitStream::XS::add_code(
      { package   => __PACKAGE__,
        name      => 'OmegaGolomb',
        universal => 1,
        params    => 1,
        encodesub => sub {shift->put_golomb( sub {shift->put_omega(@_)}, @_ )},
        decodesub => sub {shift->get_golomb( sub {shift->get_omega(@_)}, @_ )},
      }
   );

which registers the name C<OmegaGolomb> as a new universal code that takes
one parameter.  Given a stream C<$stream>, this is now allowed:

   $stream->erase_for_write;
   $stream->code_put("OmegaGolomb(5)", 477);
   $stream->rewind_for_read;
   my $value = $stream->code_get("OmegaGolomb(5)");
   die unless $value == 477;

These methods are only valid while the stream is in reading state.

=over 4

=item B< rewind >

Moves the position to the stream beginning.

=item B< exhausted >

Returns true is the stream is at the end.  Rarely used.

=item B< read($bits [, 'readahead']) >

Reads C<$bits> from the stream and returns the value.
C<$bits> must be between C<1> and C<maxbits>.

The position is advanced unless the second argument is the string 'readahead'.

Attempting to read past the end of the stream is a fatal error.  However,
readahead is allowed as it is speculative.  All positions past the end of
the stream will always be filled with zero bits.

=item B< readahead($bits>) >

Identical to calling read with 'readahead' as the second argument.
Returns the value of the next C<$bits> bits (between C<1> and C<maxbits>).
Returns undef if the current position is at the end.
Allows reading past the end of the stream (fills with zeros as necessary).
Does not advance the position.

=item B< skip($bits) >

Advances the position C<$bits> bits.  Used in conjunction with C<readahead>.

Attempting to skip past the end of the stream is a fatal error.

=item B< read_string($bits) >

Reads C<$bits> bits from the stream and returns them as a binary string, such
as C<'0011011'>.  Attempting to read past the end of the stream is a fatal
error.

=back




=head2 OBJECT METHODS (I<writing>)

These methods are only valid while the stream is in writing state.

=over 4

=item B< write($bits, $value) >

Writes C<$value> to the stream using C<$bits> bits.
C<$bits> must be between C<1> and C<maxbits>, unless C<value> is 0 or 1, in
which case C<bits> may be larger than C<maxbits>.

The stream length will be increased by C<$bits> bits.
Regardless of the contents of C<$value>, exactly C<$bits> bits will be used.
If C<$value> has more non-zero bits than C<$bits>, the lower bits are written.
In other words, C<$value> will be effectively masked before writing.

=item B< put_string(@strings) >

Takes one or more binary strings (e.g. C<'1001101'>, C<'001100'>) and
writes them to the stream.  The number of bits used for each value is equal
to the string length.

=item B< put_stream($source_stream) >

Writes the contents of C<$source_stream> to the stream.  This is a helper
method that might be more efficient than doing it in one of the many other
possible ways.  The default implementation uses:

  $self->put_string( $source_stream->to_string );

=item B< put_raw($packed, [, $bits]) >

Writes the packed big-endian vector C<$packed> which has C<$bits> bits of data.
If C<$bits> is not present, then C<length($packed)> will be used as the
byte-length.  It is recommended that you include C<$bits>.

=back




=head2 OBJECT METHODS (I<conversion>)

These methods may be called at any time, and will adjust the state of the
stream.

=over 4

=item B< to_string >

Returns the stream as a binary string, e.g. '00110101'.

=item B< to_raw >

Returns the stream as packed big-endian data.  This form is portable to
any other implementation on any architecture.

=item B< to_store >

Returns the stream as some scalar holding the data in some implementation
specific way.  This may be portable or not, but it can always be read by
the same implementation.  It might be more efficient than the raw format.

=item B< from_string($string) >

The stream will be set to the binary string C<$string>.

=item B< from_raw($packed [, $bits]) >

The stream is set to the packed big-endian vector C<$packed> which has
C<$bits> bits of data.  If C<$bits> is not present, then C<length($packed)>
will be used as the byte-length.  It is recommended that you include C<$bits>.

=item B< from_store($blob [, $bits]) >

Similar to C<from_raw>, but using the value returned by C<to_store>.

=back




=head2 OBJECT METHODS (I<other>)

=over 4

=item B< pos >

A read-only non-negative integer indicating the current position in a read
stream.  It is advanced by C<read>, C<get>, and C<skip> methods, as well
as changed by C<to>, C<from>, C<rewind>, and C<erase> methods.

=item B< len >

A read-only non-negative integer indicating the current length of the stream
in bits.  It is advanced by C<write> and C<put> methods, as well as changed
by C<from> and C<erase> methods.

=item B< maxlen >

A read-only non-negative integer indicating the current storage size of the
stream in bits.  This will always be greater than or equal to the stream
C<len>.  Applications will not normally need to know this.

=item B< trim >

Resizes the data to the stream C<len>, releasing all expansion space to
the system.  Not normally needed.

=item B< writing >

A read-only boolean indicating whether the stream is open for writing or
reading.  Methods for read such as
C<read>, C<get>, C<skip>, C<rewind>, C<skip>, and C<exhausted>
are not allowed while writing.  Methods for write such as
C<write> and C<put>
are not allowed while reading.

The C<write_open> and C<erase_for_write> methods will set writing to true.
The C<write_close> and C<rewind_for_read> methods will set writing to false.

The read/write distinction allows implementations more freedom in internal
caching of data.  For instance, they can gather writes into blocks.  It also
can be helpful in catching mistakes such as reading from a target stream.

=item B< erase >

Erases all the data, while the writing state is left unchanged.  The position
and length will both be 0 after this is finished.

=item B< read_open >

Reads the current input file, if one exists.

=item B< write_open >

Changes the state to writing with no other API-visible changes.

=item B< write_close >

Changes the state to reading, and the position is set to the end of the
stream.  No other API-visible changes happen.

=item B< erase_for_write >

A helper function that performs C<erase> followed by C<write_open>.

=item B< rewind_for_read >

A helper function that performs C<write_close> followed by C<rewind>.

=item B< fheader >

Returns the contents of the header lines read if the C<fheaderlines> option was
given to C<new>.A  This allows one to read the header of an image format, with
the stream pointing to the data, and the header contents easily obtainable.
Unfortunately it isn't completely generic, as it assumes a fixed number of
lines.  An alternative API would be to have a user supplied sub.

=back




=head2 OBJECT METHODS (I<coding>)

All coding methods are biased to 0.  This means values from 0 to 2^maxbits-1
(for universal codes) may be encoded, even if the original code as published
starts with 1.

All C<get_> methods take an optional count as the last argument.
If C<$count> is C<1> or not supplied, a single value will be read.
If C<$count> is positive, that many values will be read.
If C<$count> is negative, values are read until the end of the stream.

C<get_> methods called in list context will return a list of all values read.
Called in scalar context they return the last value read.

C<put_> methods take one or more values as input after any optional
parameters and write them to the stream.  All values must be non-negative
integers that do not exceed the maximum encodable value (typically ~0, but
may be lower for some codes depending on parameter, and non-universal codes
will be practically limited to smaller values).

=over 4

=item B< get_unary([$count]) >

=item B< put_unary(@values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in C<0000...1> unary coding.
Unary coding is only appropriate for relatively small numbers, as it uses
C<$value + 1> bits per value.

=item B< get_unary1([$count]) >

=item B< put_unary1(@values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in C<1111...0> unary coding.

=item B< get_binword($bits, [$count]) >

=item B< put_binword($bits, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream as fixed-length binary
numbers, each using C<$bits> bits.

=item B< get_omega([$count]) >

=item B< put_omega(@values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Elias Omega coding.

=item B< get_levenstein([$count]) >

=item B< put_levenstein(@values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Even-Rodeh coding.

=item B< get_goldbach_g1([$count]) >

=item B< put_goldbach_g1(@values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Goldbach G1 coding.

=item B< get_goldbach_g2([$count]) >

=item B< put_goldbach_g2(@values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Goldbach G2 coding.

=item B< get_fib([$count]) >

=item B< put_fib(@values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Fibonacci coding.
Specifically, the order C<m=2> C1 codes of Fraenkel and Klein.

=item B< get_fibgen($m [, $count]) >

=item B< put_fibgen($m, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in generalized Fibonacci
coding.  The order C<m> should be between 2 and 16.  These codes are
described in Klein and Ben-Nissan (2004).  For C<m=2> the results are
identical to the standard C1 form.

=item B< get_comma($bits [, $count]) >

=item B< put_comma($bits, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Comma coding.  The number
of bits C<bits> should be between 1 and 16.  C<bits=1> implies Unary coding.
C<bits=2> is the ternary comma code.  No leading zeros are used.

=item B< get_blocktaboo($taboo [, $count]) >

=item B< put_blocktaboo($taboo, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in block-based Taboo coding.
The parameter C<taboo> is the binary string of the taboo code to use, such
as C<'00'>.  C<taboo='1'> implies Unary coding.  C<taboo='0'> implies Unary1
coding.  No more than 16 bits of taboo code may be given.
These codes are a more efficient version of comma codes, as they allow
leading zeros.

=item B< get_golomb($m [, $count]) >

=item B< put_golomb($m, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Golomb coding.

=item B< get_golomb(sub { ... }, $m [, $count]) >

=item B< put_golomb(sub { ... }, $m, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Golomb coding using the
supplied subroutine instead of unary coding, which can make them work with
large outliers.  For example to use Fibonacci coding for the base:

  $stream->put_golomb( sub {shift->put_fib(@_)}, $m, $value);

  $value = $stream->get_golomb( sub {shift->get_fib(@_)}, $m);

=item B< get_rice($k [, $count]) >

=item B< put_rice($k, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Rice coding, which is
the time efficient case where C<m = 2^k>.

=item B< get_rice(sub { ... }, $k [, $count]) >

=item B< put_rice(sub { ... }, $k, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Rice coding using the
supplied subroutine instead of unary coding, which can make them work with
large outliers.  For example to use Omega coding for the base:

  $stream->put_rice( sub {shift->put_omega(@_)}, $k, $value);

  $value = $stream->get_rice( sub {shift->get_omega(@_)}, $k);

=item B< get_gammagolomb($m [, $count]) >

=item B< put_gammagolomb($m, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Golomb coding using
Elias Gamma codes for the base.  This is a convenience since they are common.

=item B< get_gamma_golomb($m [, $count]) >

=item B< put_gamma_golomb($m, @values) >

Aliases for C<get_gammagolomb> and C<put_gammagolomb>.

Elias Gamma codes for the base.  This is a convenience since they are common.

=item B< get_gamma_rice($k [, $count]) >

=item B< put_gamma_rice($k, @values) >

Aliases for C<get_expgolomb> and C<put_expgolomb>.  This name better describes
the algorithm, but is not in common use.

=item B< get_baer($k [, $count]) >

=item B< put_baer($k, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Baer c_k coding.  The
parameter C<k> must be between C<-32> and C<32>.

=item B< get_boldivigna($k [, $count]) >

=item B< put_boldivigna($k, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in the Zeta coding of
Paolo Boldi and Sebastiano Vigna.  The parameter C<k> must be between C<1>
and C<maxbits> (C<32> or C<64>).  Typical values for C<k> are between C<2>
and C<6>.

=item B< get_arice($k [, $count]) >

=item B< put_arice($k, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Adaptive Rice coding.
Technically this is ExpGolomb coding since the default method for encoding
the base is using the Elias Gamma code.
The value of $k will adapt to better fit the values.  This interface will
likely change to make C<$k> a reference.

=item B< get_arice(sub { ... }, $k [, $count]) >

=item B< put_arice(sub { ... }, $k, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values from the stream in Adaptive Rice coding using
the supplied subroutine instead of Elias Gamma coding to encode the base.
The value of $k will adapt to better fit the values.  This interface will
likely change to make C<$k> a reference.

=item B< get_startstop(\@m [, $count]) >

=item B< put_startstop(\@m, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values using Start/Stop codes.  The parameter is an
array reference which can be an anonymous array, for example:

  my @array2 = $stream->get_startstop( [0,3,2,0], -1);

=item B< get_startstepstop(\@m [, $count]) >

=item B< put_startstepstop(\@m, @values) >

Reads/writes one or more values using Start-Step-Stop codes.  The parameter
is an array reference which can be an anonymous array, for example:

  $stream->put_startstepstop( [3,2,9], @array );
  my @array3 = $stream->get_startstepstop( [3,2,9], -1);

=item B< code_get($code, [, $count]) >

=item B< code_put($code, @values ) >

These methods wrap up all the previous encoding and decoding methods in an
internal dispatch table.
C<code> is a text name of the code, such as C<'Gamma'>, C<'Fibonacci'>, etc.
Codes with parameters are called as C<'Rice(2)'>, C<'StartStop(0-0-2-4-14)'>,
etc.

  # $use_rice and $k obtained from options, parameters, or wherever.
  my $code = $use_rice ? "Rice($k)" : "Delta";
  my $nvalues = scalar @values;
  $stream->code_put($code, @values);
  # ....
  my @vals = $stream->code_get($code, $nvalues);
  print "Read $nvalues values with code '$code':  ", join(',', @vals), "\n";

=head2 SEQUENCE METHODS (I<class methods>)

These methods are exported to allow testing, and because they may be of some
use for callers.  They are not directly related.

=over 4

=item B<is_prime($n)>

Given an unsigned integer C<n>, returns 0 if the number is not prime, 1 if it
is prime.  The algorithm currently used is trial division.  Speed is
approximately equal to the code used by L<Math::Prime::XS> version 0.26
(the algorithms are identical).  The algorithm may be changed.

=item B<next_prime($n)>

Given an unsigned integer C<n>, returns the next prime number.  This is
accomplished by trying C<is_prime> each number greater than C<n> (skipping
multiples of 2, 3, and 5) until a prime is found.  No memory is used during
the process.  The number returned will always be greater than C<n>, barring
any possibility of unsigned long overflow.

Note that the sequence of primes starts with 2, 3, 5, 7, ...

=item B<primes($low, $high)>

Returns an array of all primes in the range C<low> to <high> inclusive.  The
algorithm used is subject to change and may be dynamic depending on the range
values and/or delta.  Currently it uses repeated calls to C<next_prime>, which
is low memory and efficient for small ranges, but is much slower than sieving
for larger ranges.  A change to range sieving using a bit vector is planned.
