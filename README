Data::BitStream::XS version 0.01
================================

A class providing read/write access to bit streams, implemented in XS for
speed.  It includes many integer coding methods.

Bit streams are often used in data compression and in embedded products where
memory is at a premium.

I have not gone all-out optimizing the underlying C code.  While shaving
cycles is crucial for the inner loops on embedded products, this code is
being called from Perl so the main benefit will come from efficiently
getting in and out of the C code.  This class is over 50x faster than the
Pure Perl Mouse class, and over 100x faster than Pure Perl Moose.

It turns out that for most uses we can get almost all the performance benefit
while still using the Moose/Mouse wrapper for Yummy Perly Goodness.  Hence
the Data::BitStream class will attempt to use this module if it is installed.


SYNOPSIS

  use Data::BitStream::XS;
  my $stream = Data::BitStream::XS->new;
  $stream->put_gamma($_) for (1 .. 20);
  $stream->rewind_for_read;
  my @values = $stream->get_gamma(-1);

See the POD module documentation for examples and more information on all the
methods included.
